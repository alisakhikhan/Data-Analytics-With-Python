**Project Overview** 
The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset detailing Nobel Laureates to address several key questions about the demographics and achievements of the award recipients. Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I performed a series of analyses to extract insights and visualize trends. The primary questions explored were:

1. Which gender and birth country are most commonly represented among Nobel Prize winners?
2. In which decade was the ratio of US-born winners to total winners the highest across all categories?
3. Which decade and category combination saw the highest proportion of female laureates?
4. Who was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, and in what category did she win?
5. Which individuals or organizations have received multiple Nobel Prizes?
   
Additionally, I calculated the estimated age of laureates at the time of their award and attempted to predict their year of death. This aspect of the analysis aimed to explore my hypothesis that achieving significant milestones might impact the lifespan of these individuals, under the assumption that significant achievements could diminish life aspirations.

**Findings and Hypothesis Testing** 
The analysis disproved my initial hypothesis that laureates might have a reduced desire to live after achieving a pinnacle in their careers, as suggested by the low R-squared value in the predictive modeling of their lifespan. This outcome indicates that the age at death of laureates is influenced by factors other than merely the timing of their awards, pointing to the need for a more complex model to accurately predict life expectancy.

**Conclusion** 
This project not only provided valuable insights into the patterns of Nobel Prize awards but also highlighted the complexities of life expectancy post-major achievements. Future work might include a more sophisticated modeling approach, incorporating a broader set of variables to better understand the determinants of longevity among Nobel Laureates.
