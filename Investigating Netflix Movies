Netflix has come a long way since its inception in 1997 as a DVD rental service, evolving into one of the entertainment industry's giants. With its vast library of movies and series, it presents an exciting opportunity to apply my exploratory data analysis skills. Recently, I've been honing my Python skills and decided to take on the challenge of analyzing a CSV file containing Netflix data. My hypothesis, inspired by a friend's initial research, revolves around the belief that the average duration of movies on Netflix has been on the decline. Now, armed with their findings, I'm set to delve into the dataset and investigate whether movie lengths are indeed getting shorter, exploring potential contributing factors along the way.
