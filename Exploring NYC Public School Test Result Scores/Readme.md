Every year, as American high school students go through the ritual of taking SATs, those standardized tests measuring reading, math, and writing skills, with a max score of 800 points in each section, the importance of these exams becomes clear in the college admissions journey. Analyzing how schools perform on these SATs is not just crucial for students and colleges, but it matters to policymakers, educators, researchers, the government, and parents like me, trying to figure out the best school for our kids. Armed with a dataset named schools.csv, I'm delving into the SAT performance of New York City (NYC) public schools, aiming to answer key questions. This dataset serves as a valuable resource, offering insights that can shape education policies, improve teaching methods, and assist parents in making informed decisions about their children's education.
